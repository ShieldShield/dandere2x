dandere2x.Dandere2x Source Code. Not very organized at the moment.


For CPP module, I recommend either using netbeans or eclipse since the two are pretty much compatible. There's no dependent libaries insisde,
so it should work out of the box. Only tested with cygwin c++ compiler at the moment.

The java component is compiled / made in intelij, but IDE shouldn't be as problematic. 

Over the next week I plan on cleaning up the project, i.e making c++ more professional (although I've had issues with .cpp files in the past).
